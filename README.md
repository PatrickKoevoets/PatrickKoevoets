Hi, I’m Patrick Koevoets. I’m passionate about what I do, and I love to help people. Nothing is more fulfilling than being part of a team with similar interests, and an organization that values its employees.
I my work i'm helping organizations with digital transformation, cloud rebel, drive positive change and innovation, next steps, and just being a nerd.

With more than 20 Year of IT experience and more than 15 years in IT Consulting, technical pre-sales and architecture. Personally I like unite the different fields of technology to facilitate end-users and business with innovative solutions. Heavily taking into account that the solutions are not only about linking systems but also about connecting people and delivering functionality and enabling the business. The last 10+ years I was responsible for guiding customers in finding the optimal solution for their organization, by inquiring customer’s challenges and requirements and transforming them into strategic and technical solutions.
My passion for my work helps me to enthusiasm the people around me and myself. My focus is not to think in problems but in solutions in the centre of technology, processes and people
